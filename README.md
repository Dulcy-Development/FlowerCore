# FlowerCore-Recode

FlowerCore is a plugin I made with friends whilst learning java. This was meant to be a private server core at first, then I wanted to start selling it. I eventually ended up open sourcing it. If you fork and improve this, it could be useful for your future server.

## Features

- **Rank Management**: Create and manage player ranks with custom permissions.
- **Tags System**: Assign and display custom tags for players.
- **Profile Management**: Store and manage player profiles efficiently.
- **MongoDB Integration**: Seamless integration for data storage.
- **Configurable Menus**: Easy customization of menus for player interactions.
- **Grant System**: Grant ranks and permissions with a confirmation menu.
- **Punishments**: Ban, blacklist or mute players.
- **And more..**

## Installation

1. **Download**: Get the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/Emmiesa/FlowerCore-Recode/releases) page.
2. **Place**: Move the downloaded `.jar` file into your server's `plugins` directory.
3. **Configure**: Adjust settings in the `plugins/FlowerCore-Recode` directory to suit your server's needs.
4. **Launch**: Start or restart your Minecraft server.
